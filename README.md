<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction

PEP-DNA is a Performance Enhancing Proxy designed specifically for Deploying new Network Architectures. It is implemented in the Linux kernel and can be installed wherever a translation needs to occur between a new architecture and TCP/IP domains. PEP-DNA is currently able to interconnect a TCP connection with (i) another TCP connection, and (ii) the Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (Visit http://pouzinsociety.org to read more about RINA). This README file provides information on repeating and replicating the results of the paper. For more information on how to use PEP-DNA in different scenarios, check the Tutorials on the <a href="https://github.com/kr1stj0n/testREADME/wiki">Wiki</a> pages.

<!-- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS -->
## Build instructions

We have tested PEP-DNA with Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, Debian 8 and 9 with kernel versions between 4.1.x and 4.19.x. In order to run all the experiments described in the paper, PEP-DNA needs to be built with RINA support. RINA stack is available at https://github.com/IRATI/stack. We also include all the RINA kernel modules and libraries in this repository to facilitate the installation process.
*Note* that a user with sudo privileges is required to load PEP-DNA and RINA kernel modules and to apply other commands.

### Prerequisites

First, install user-space dependencies which are required to build RINA.
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install build-essentials autoconf automake libtool pkg-config git g++ libssl-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev socat python python3 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
  ```
Install libnl-3-dev for Netlink sockets support.
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libnl-3-dev
   ```
Additional tools are required to configure Linux hosts, run the experiments and collect information.
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install sysstat ethtool cpufrequtils httping httperf apache2
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository. We recommend to clone the repo in the root directory so that it matches the path used in the scripts.
   ```sh
   cd /
   git clone https://github.com//pep-dna.git
   ```
2. Build and install RINA's kernel-space and user-space software
   ```sh
   cd /pep-dna
   sudo ./configure
   sudo make install
   ```
3. Configure and install PEP-DNA
   ```sh
   cd /pep-dna/pepdna
   sudo ./configure --with-rina --with-localhost
   sudo make all
   sudo make install
   ```

   To configure PEP-DNA with RINA support ```--with-rina``` flag needs to be used. Use ```--with-debug``` to build PEP-DNA with DEBUG flag.
   *Note* that building in debug mode will reduce the performance of the proxy and print detailed logging in the kern.log file. When PEP-DNA runs at the same host as the server, it needs to be configured with ```---with-localhost``` flag in order to enable full transpacency at this case (More details will be provided later). For our experiments, the commands above are sufficient.
4. All the testing applications and scripts used to run the experiments, collect the results and plot the graphs are located in https://github.com/kr1stj0n/pep-dna/tree/main/pepdnapps . Run the following commands to install them to ```/usr/bin/```.
   ```sh
   cd /pep-dna/pepdnapps
   sudo make all
   sudo make install
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Reproducibility

We aim to make our work entirely reproducible and encourage interested researchers to test the code and replicate the reported experimental results. The PEP-DNA implementation and documentation needed to reproduce all the experiments described in the paper are available in this public repository. The tools we developed to the run the experiments were installed at Step 4 of the previous section. The scripts for automated testing, analysis and plotting of the generated data are located at https://github.com/kr1stj0n/pep-dna/tree/main/pepdnapps/scripts/
